Ver 1.02:
-Added a Perk Bonus pane to the Menu pane

-Buffed Lucky perk. Its base bonus is now 20% (up from 5%). I think this perk is only good in the early game and is not as strong in the late game

-Slowed down the game speed increase rate (from +0.1 target/15s to +0.1 target/20s)

-Hourglass perk no longer slows down the target spawning speed

Ver 1.03:
-Buffed Full Clear perk. It now no longer uses up 15% of your current score.

-Changed Score Up perk. Its base bonus is now 20% (up from 10%). Its bonus per stack is now 5% (down from 10%). This perk seems very strong through out testing. A good player can easily obtain up to 200% bonus. This outdoes its counterpart Double Score perk by a good margin. These changes will bring it closer to its counterpart and still be a rewarding perk.

-Nerfed Slow Down perk. Its bonus per stack is now 4% (down from 5%). Similar to Score Up perk, a good player can easily obtain up to 100% bonus. This also outdoes its counterpart Hourglass by a good margin.

-Nerfed Size Up perk. Its bonus per stack is now 4% (down from 5%).

-Hourglass' effect now stacks.
